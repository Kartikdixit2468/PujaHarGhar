# 🙏 Pujaharghar – Online Puja Booking App (React Native)

Hey there! 👋  
This is my **current project**, called **Pujaharghar**, and while I don’t work on it daily, I am steadily building it. Initially, I started this to bring the **concept of online puja bookings and spiritual services to every home**, but later I decided to make it **open source**, so more people can contribute, learn, and make it better. 🚀

## 🎯 Purpose of the App

In India, spiritual practices and rituals like **pujas** are deeply rooted in culture.  
However, not everyone can easily connect with a **pandit (priest)**, arrange rituals, or handle payments smoothly.  

That’s where **Pujaharghar** comes in:  

- 🌐 **Bridge the gap** between devotees and priests through technology.  
- 📅 Allow users to **book pujas online** from their phones.  
- 💳 Enable **secure digital payments** for rituals, donations, and services.  
- 📱 Provide a **simple and modern mobile experience** that preserves tradition.

## ✨ Features (Work in Progress)

Here are the main features I’m building (and open for contributions to improve 👇):

- 🔑 **Google Sign-In Authentication**  
- 📲 **User profile management** (basic details, saved addresses, etc.)  
- 🧘 **Browse & book pujas** (with descriptions, required items, duration, etc.)  
- 💳 **Payments via Razorpay** (secure & easy integration)  
- 📜 **My Bookings** (history and upcoming pujas)  
- 🔔 **Push Notifications** (reminders & updates — planned)  
- 🎥 **Virtual Pujas** (live or recorded session option — future idea)  
- 🕉️ **Localized experience** (support for Hindi/English, extendable to more languages)
